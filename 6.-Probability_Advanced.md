### T-test: One-Sample

``` r

#Ha: significant difference between means... USE THIS IF REJECT
# Result: For both groups, we reject the hypothesis. In other words, there is a significant difference in means

#From the ANOVA results, you can conclude the following, based on the p-values and a significance level of 0.05:
#the p-value of supp is 0.000429 (significant), which indicates that the levels of supp are associated with significant different tooth length.
#the p-value of dose is < 2e-16 (significant), which indicates that the levels of dose are associated with significant different tooth length.
#the p-value for the interaction between supp*dose is 0.02 (significant), which indicates that the relationships between dose and tooth length depends on the supp method.

A data science student is using three machine learning algorithms to analyze a given
dataset. She tests her model first with a Decision Tree, secondly with a Logistic Regression and then with a Naive Bayes algorithm. She uses 10-fold Cross Validation for each
model. With this method, she randomly divides her dataset into 10 parts and uses 9 of
those parts for training and reserves one tenth for testing. She repeats this procedure
10 times, each time reserving a different tenth-part for testing. Although the cross validation uses different test sets for each run, she makes sure that the three algorithms get
the same test set. Then, she records the Accuracy for each fold. The accuracy for each
