# RTraining
This repository contains R markdown codes with comment lines, comment cells and outputs that explain the use of different R built-in methods like vectors, matrices, dataframes, probability functions, loops, and libraries like Dplyr, tidyr, ggplot and more. I hope it guides you to start your programming experience! Below you have more details of the content.


# 1. R Basics, Vector, Matrices, Functions and loops
- Arithmetics: Sum, Product, Exponential, Power, Square Root, MOdulus, division
- Vector Assignment, length, random vectors, recycle property, sequence nmrs vector, recursive vector
- Data Types (numeric, character, Date, logical)
- Matrices (cbind and rbind), Create Matrix, Inverse Matrix, Transpose, Multiplication, Dimensions and other useful functions
- Logical Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions (if and while)

# 2. Dataframes, lists and arrays
- Create dummy DF
- Rename columns
- Copy columns
- Add, delete or edit colums/rows
- Load built-in DF
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Mean, min, max, correlation matrix)
- Indexing
- DF Filtering
- Sort DF
- Pattern Matching and replacement
- Arrays
- Lists

# 3. Graphs
- Lineplot
- Bar Charts
- Histograms
- Pie Charts
- ggplot Histograms
- ggplot scatterplot
- ggplot bar chart (Themes)
- Normal Distribution graph
- Linear Regression
- Boxplots
- Correlation PLots (heatmaps)


# 4. Dplyr and Tidyr
- Filter 
- Arrange
- Select
- Distinct
- Count
- Mutate
- Transmutate
- Summarise
- Pipe Operator
- Correlation


# 5. Probability
- Binomial Probability Distribution
- Poisson Probability Distribution
- Binomial Vs Poisson (The Poisson Approximation to binomial)
- Hypergeometric Probability Distribution
- The Normal Distribution
- Sampling Distribution
- Central Limit Theorem
- Linear Regression
- Correlation (Pearson and Spearman)
- Hypothesis Testing / T-Test


# 6. Probability (Advanced)
- T-Test one sample
- T-Test two independent samples (welch)
- T-Test two dependent samples (paired)
- ANOVA: One-way
- ANOVA: Two-way
- Chi Square goodnes of fit
- Chi Square Test of Independence
- Wilcoxon Test: One-sample test
- Wilcoxon Test: Rank sum
- Wilcoxon Test: Signed
